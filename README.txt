The newest versions of the "DragonBlock Beyond" mod project will now be developed on Minecraft 1.18

The current goal is to reproduce the features present in the version of the mod for Minecraft 1.16, but with MUCH better
execution and simply better content (the mod shouldn't look like it's from MCreator people [Me]).

Afterwards, the goal is to finally start with the "more dragonball" type content.

    Custom Animated Player Models (with elbows, knees, and more) abound with customization options
    (more akin to character creators for other games that start with a base model that user build off of)

    Better 3rd person camera movement (don't want people getting sick with excess rotation of the camera for certain things)

    A fighting system with both Physical and Ki skills (that are leveled up through use and possibly a "tweaking" system
    [IRL skills rarely become better by doing them the EXACT same way everytime, finding more efficient methods mean improvement])

    A Heavy Duty Story System (This isn't FTB Quests). Options to include images and text in a visual novel style,
    video clips, or just a simple perspective change of the existing world location and a text box.
    (The biggest point is user created stories to allow people to make their own stories [literally] and let other people play them)

    And More.... but it will probably be a while before the mod arrives at the point of adding more than the above listed features.


All help is appreciated, and if you are on this github page then you probably have access to the mod's discord server.
If you want ot help with the project, go there.
If you don't have access to the server, post a github "issue" about joining the team.
